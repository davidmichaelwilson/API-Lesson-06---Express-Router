# Instructions  

---

The Monty Hall Gameshow needs your help. They've got two 
problems:

1) They don't want to have to write Express routes for all
of the files in their 'public' directory. Write one line
of code near the top of 'index.js' that will statically
serve up all of these files to the client.

2) Their 'index.js' file is cluttered with all of the
code and routes that describe on the backend how the program should
respond when they are clicked on the frontend. Without changing
any of the logic of how the app works, move the `/doors/1`, `/doors/2`,
`/doors/3`, and `/doors/reset` routes into 'routes.js'. The same code
should be accessible at the same routes, just organized into a different
file using the Express Router.

Before continuing, familiarize
yourself with the code in this project. Once you understand it,
get started on reorganizing this code! Only add code to 'index.js'
and 'routes.js'.
